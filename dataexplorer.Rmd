Exploratory Data Analysis plays a very important role in the entire Data Science Workflow. In fact, this takes most of the time of the Data science Workflow. There's a nice quote (not sure who said it) 

*"In Data Science, 80% of time spent prepare data, 20% of time spent complain about need for prepare data."* 

With R being the go-to language for a lot of Data Analysts, EDA requires an R Programmer to get a couple of packages from the infamous `tidyverse` world into their R code - even for the most basic EDA with some Bar plots and Histograms. 

Recently, I came across this package `DataExplorer` that seems to be doing the entire EDA (at least, the typical basic EDA) with just one function `create_report()` that generates a nice presentable rendered Rmarkdown html document. That's just a report automatically generated and what if you want the control of what you would like to perform EDA on, for which `DataExplorer` has got a couple of *plotting* functions for the same purpose. 

### Let us begin our EDA by loading the library:

```{r}
library(DataExplorer)
```


### Loading input dataset into our R session for EDA:

```{r}
choco <- read.csv('C:/Users/SA31/Downloads/flavors_of_cacao.csv', header = T, stringsAsFactors = F)

```

### Some Format changes in the input data. 

```{r, echo = F}

choco$Cocoa.Percent <- as.numeric(gsub('%','',choco$Cocoa.Percent))

choco$Review.Date <- as.character(choco$Review.Date)

```


### Variables 

The very first thing that you'd want to do in your EDA is checking the dimension of the input dataset and the time of variables.  

```{r}
plot_str(choco)
```

With that, we can see we've got some Continuous variables and some Categorical variables. 

### Man's search for Missing Values


```{r}
plot_missing(choco)
```

And we are fortunate that there's no missing value in this dataset. 

### Histogram of Continuous Variables

```{r}
plot_histogram(choco)
```

### Perhaps, you are a fan of Density plot

```{r}
plot_density(choco)
```

### Colorful Correlation Plot

```{r}
plot_correlation(choco, type = 'continuous','Review.Date')
```

### Time for some Categorical Variables - Barplots!

```{r}
plot_bar(choco) 
```

And finally, if you have got only a couple of minutes (just like in the maggi noodles ad, 2 mins!) just keep it simple to use `create_report()`

```{r}
#create_report(choco) #comment this if you're not rendering this entire rmarkdown
```
